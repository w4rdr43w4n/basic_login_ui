## Overview
This is project is just a simple Login UI built from scratch for educational purposes, it contains basic and some importatnt concepts of css, js and html that beginners should know about at the beginning of their programmatic trip.
## What do I find here?
This is not a web application ,however, you can convert it into one using frameworks like , flask or django if you are using python , or express on NodeJS.

So just click on the <code>main.html</code> file try the UI, it actually stores login records in local storage so it persists over several page refreshes.
But the most important thing is to observe and understand the <code>SOURCE CODE</code>
